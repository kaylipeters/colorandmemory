#Codebook for data1.csv 

The data in data1.csv represent the data from students at Eastern Oregon University, as well as people on 
social media websites such as Facebook.  The experiment was performed on a voluntary basis (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6WmtoIuaXY).  Students at the University did receive extra credit based on the Professors discretion, not the Researchers.  
The data were hand coded from emails.

The data files include 4 variables.  

* **Condition: Condition represents the condition the participant was in.  
The condition determined congruence or incongruence.  The condition was selected based on the month of birth of the participant.  
Participants indicated which condition they were in by indicating condition 1 through 4 in the emails.  
* **Valence: Valence represents the positive and negative
emotions evoked by the target words.  Participants were asked to rank each target word 
by a valence ranking system.  
* **Remember: Remember represents whether or not the participant recalled the 
target word.  
* **Congruence: Congruence represents whether or not the participant 
was placed in a congruent condition or not.
